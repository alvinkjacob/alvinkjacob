Hey, Hi there! My name is Alvin Jacob. I'm a 19 year old Software Engineering Degree Apprentice student at Vodafone, studying for the BSc Digital & Technology Solutions Degree (accredited by the Univeristy of Lancaster). I don't have much of a technical background, so have been self-learning coding for a while now. Any tips will be welcome! :) I look forward to developing my profile on GitHub, and having fun.
